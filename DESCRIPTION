    cleaning that allows users to specify implicit and explicit missing data,
    regular expressions for both data and columns, and global matches, while
    respecting ordering of factors. This package is part of the 'RECON'
    (<https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/>) toolkit for outbreak analysis.
